	<p title="Hello every one.">It was the 1st of December and the year was 1757 on the Eastern banks of Lake Huron, a group of 500 men were
		camping. These men were the Frontier Rangers. Who was sent by British command to scout out and conduct raids on
		the French and their Indian allies. Just before the sun was about to rise, the men were just sleeping, then
		their Commander Colonel Alfred Johnson woke the men up at 4:30 in the morning. He called out his men to wake up,
		pack up, and continue marching towards the Franco-Ontarian region, where a French fort is located. Among the
		men, there was a 17-year-old boy named Edward Johnson who was a young Private and the youngest among the group.
		He was Colonel Johnson's nephew and wanted to become a soldier in the British army as his father was.
		As the men marched towards the fort, deep inside enemy territory, they felt pain in their old leather boots. And
		in the march 5 men became sick due to the cold climate. “We would have frozen to death if it wasn’t for the
		Indian hunter.”, one of the men talks rudely to one of his comrades. The men were chatting about their Indian
		guide from Ohio Country.
		As the regiment reached the Outskirts of an Algonquian village. The village surrounds the French fort that the
		British command ordered to raid and siege control. As the men entered the village, their native American guide
		Ahiga was only standing at the entrance of the village. “Oi! Ahiga! What’s the matter?”, the Colonel called out
		to his Indian guide. Ahiga just took a step back and ran away from there. The way he ran made the Colonel feel
		something in his gut-deep down that whatever happened to the village and the fort he and his men wanted no part
		of.</p>

	<p style="color: brown;">Then one of his lieutenants, Liam L Bradly, a man in his early 30s, said, “We should continue and capture the
		fort. As winter is coming. Sir!” Colonel decided to complete the task and get him and his men back to
		Philadelphia within 3 nights. As they marched towards the fort. One of the men vomited when they came in contact
		with a horrible smell. But still they continued marching and they reached the entrance of the fort. When the men
		opened the door, they that it was totally empty.</p>
	<p>
		Colonel Johnson decided they should stay in the fort when the British Command sent reinforcement to the fort
		after 8 days, as night was coming and snow started to fall. As the men went out look around the village and the
		fort, not caring about the fear of wild animals in the forest as they knew that bears, wolves, and mountain
		lions would be hibernating. The Colonel decided to take a glass of rum to the fort's war room where his nephew
		was eating his dinner and he accidentally bumped into a box on the table.</p>
	<p>
		Filled with curiosity Edward opened the box and found a bunch of papers and 2 books in it. As the young Edward
		knew French, he was able to read the contents of the papers. The papers talk about a small disagreement between
		the French and their Native American allies, but before he was about continue reading, he heard the cocking
		sound of a Flintlock behind him. When he turned round, he saw a French soldier pointing a pistol at his uncle
		who was unaware of the as he was drunk. Edward reacted by pointing his Musket at the French intruder. And in
		French, he ordered the solder to drop his pistol. And to the young Private's surprise, the man dropped his
		pistol, which resulted in the Colonel turning around and seeing the Frenchmen covered in mud and some dried
		stains of blood on his uniform, with one white eye and his uniform in rages. Before the Colonel would do
		anything, the ragged solder began to say, “Tous sont morts…, cela virendra…, vous êtes le prochain…” The man was
		saying this again and again. When the Colonel asked Edward to translate what the man was saying. Edward replied,
		“He is saying ‘All are dead, it will come, you are next'.”</p>
	<p>
		Colonel Johnson was irritated by what he heard from his nephew and was about to kill him with his pistol, but
		then the Frenchman collapsed due to his injuries. After the incident of the first night the next day, Lieutenant
		Bradly decided to count how many men they had. After counting he then he realizes that out of the 500 men only
		490 were there. He asked one of the captains about the whereabouts and what had happened to the missing 10 men.
		One of them replies that last night, he had sent the men to guard the village, but didn’t come back, he suspense
		that got drunk or got frozen in the cold night.</p>
	<p>
		The lieutenant decided to check the surrounding forest for even the dead body of one of the men. After 10 hours
		of searching one of the soldiers trips on a stone fall into a small pond and screams in terror and calls out the
		search party to his location. As they reached to the pond they stood there in horror, as they found the
		dismembered and mutilated corpses of the missing men in a pool of blood and found out that 4 of 10 bodies were
		hollowed out and some sections of the body to be eaten. One of the men named James S. William who was a priest
		and a doctor took a close look at the corpses and found them to be half eaten the bite marks were nothing that
		Dr. Will had seen, but before they could say, the lieutenant called out some of the men to see something that
		the Colonel has found.</p>
	<p>
		As the men reached the area where the Colonel was and saw the body of their Indian guide Ahiga still breathing
		and alive as he had scars on his body. The Colonel other the men to return back to the fort. All of a sudden,
		the temperature started to drop to -47° and night began to fall again in the fort. As the Colonel was planning
		to get himself and everyone, out of the village and return back home that is when he noticed a letter written by
		Edward to a girl named, Ilsa Kühn Jäger who is the daughter of Herman Kühn Jäger, he was the Colonel’s old
		German comrade. As he read it, he soon came to know that his nephew has a romantic relationship with his
		comrade's daughter. But before he could call him, Edward already entered the room.</p>
	<p>
		And as the Colonel was about to ask him about the letter the French soldier who woke up from his coma and
		started saying the same thing in English. “It is waiting for you all to be its next victim…” Edward asked him
		about ‘It’. The Soldier introduced himself as Captain Louis Joseph Philip. He explains that he was the only
		soldier of an old French Regiment, that was hunted down and turned to pieces by a group of cannibals. He says
		that their Native American airlines called them the Wendigo. Louis says, “The Wendigo is both a curse and the
		call of the wild, they say that… if anyone cannot control the urges to eat others and tried to calm down… They
		would become monsters of the winter and the forests… no weapon can kill them… as… cough you can it with fire…
		and if you do that the evil spirit will leave the body forever… *Cough cough*.”</p>
	<p>
		He also tells them that if anyone gets bitten or scratched by a wendigo, then they must control their
		cannibalistic urges and if they are unable to do that, then they will soon become a Wendigo. And he was about to
		say anything when they heard a large roar coming from the forests followed by a horrible stench of embalmed
		meat, eggs, and dried fish. Ahiga woke up due to the stench that was coming from the forest. Ahiga informs the
		Colonel to gather all his men to fight against the cannibals that will come out to eat. As fast as a young brave
		wolf, Edward calls all the men to the fort and prepares the defenses for an attack. As the men readied the
		defences one of the men noticed bright white eyes from the forest coming towards the fort and as Ahiga set up
		fire grapes around the fort they were able to see what they. The sight was just horrible for even the gods to
		see. These were men about 7 to 9 feet, with mouths covered in blood, some had antlers or deer-like heads, these
		men were totally gaunt to the point of emancipation, and their Desi-created skin pulled tightly over their
		bones. With their bones pushing out over their skin, their complexion the ash grey of death, and they all looked
		like a gaunt skeleton recently disinterred from the grave.</p>


	<p>The monsters charged at the gates either by on 2 or on all 4s and started to climb the walls of the fort with the
		speed of light. The soldiers fought with their swords, knives, guns, and canons but they all were not stopping.
		Like a swarm of insects, they were not stopping at all, dozens of men fell prey to the Wendigos. As he that the
		fort was a lost cause, Ordered Edward and Louis to run back to the British Command with Ahiga's help. As Edward
		says his final goodbyes to his only male relatives, he sees that one of the Wendigos turned its attention to
		them. And charged towards them but the stud in its was, the hungry monster thrusted its claws into the Colonel's
		chest and pressed him against the wall. As the trio got as far form away from the fort and the forest, the
		Colonel was able to drop a lighted matchstick from his hands and into a window that housed the fort's gunpowder.
	</p>
	<p>
		As they were halfway to the British Command their horses dropped the trio on the ground and ran away as they
		were startled by a massive boom behind them. As they saw the smoke coming from the area where the forts were,
		they noticed the campfire of the 13th Highlander Regiment in the distance. As they were able to walk towards the
		camp, Edward felt something wrong as the other behind him stopped suddenly, as he turned around, he was
		horrified to see Louis killed Ahiga and was eating him, as he was turning into the Wendigo. That is when Edward
		set fire to his rifle’s bayonet, and as he was finished loading his gun, Louis turned his attention from Ahiga
		to Edward. Edward looked into his eyes and Shaw had no sense of humanity only corruption and a desire to eat,
		eat, eat…
		As the mad Louis charged towards Edward, he was able to impale the burning bayonet into his chest and pulled the
		trigger. Louis was killed instantly, and Edward called uncontained from his action. Edward woke up in the tent
		of the Regiment's camp, he then felt the sense of realization that he was able to go back home in peace.</p>
